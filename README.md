# The Holy Qur'an App

A demonstration app for Flutter that targets iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, and the web and shows how it can give a fantastic cross-platform experience.
The Holy Qur'an App was carefully built by [fabrikod](https://fabrikod.com) to take into account user expectations, input methods, and idioms for each platform, guaranteeing it is comfortable on all of them. 

In addition to forking and reviewing the [MIT licensed](LICENSE.md) code available here, you can check out more information on the [Fabrikod Website](https://flutter.fabrikod.com).

### Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 

Once Flutter is setup, you can use the latest `stable` channel:
 * Run `flutter channel stable`
 * Run `flutter upgrade`

Once you're on `dev` and desktop is enabled, you're ready to run the app:
* `flutter run -d windows`
* `flutter run -d macos`
* `flutter run -d linux`
* `flutter run -d android`
* `flutter run -d ios`
* `flutter run -d web`

If you re-start your IDE, you should also see a new launch option for your current desktop platform.

### Client Keys
This repo includes a set of Keys for Cloudinary and Firebase that are on the free pricing plans. Depending on traffic, these may reach their limit. If that happens, you will need to provide your own keys in order to run the app locally, those can be found in `AppKeys.dart`. These limits should refresh each month, so your mileage will vary here.

### License
